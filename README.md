🧵 [Project Showcase] MinimalMart – Motion-first E-Commerce UI with GSAP + Next.js 15
MinimalMart is a solo-built e-commerce frontend concept, designed to explore what a motion-first, user-centric shopping experience could look like in 2025.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Next.js 15 (App Router) – for modern routing and file-based structure

Tailwind CSS 4.0 – with custom breakpoints and container logic

GSAP – powering smooth motion, soft-shake effects, and animated cart interactions

TypeScript – with modular state and strict types

🧠 Key Features
🛒 Animated Add-to-Cart with floating cart preview

🎯 Real-time filter/search with URL params + local state

📱 Responsive layout with layout-specific overrides

🌐 SEO-ready: metadata, OG image, alt tags, sitemap.xml

🎯 Design Philosophy
MinimalMart is not just about “a clean UI.”
It's about building an interface that feels alive — through soft, thoughtful motion that doesn’t get in the user’s way, but helps them engage with the product and flow naturally through each interaction.

🙋‍♂️ Looking For:
Feedback on motion flow & UX design

Devs who are into design systems + animation + solo craft

Conversations around how motion can shape perceived quality
